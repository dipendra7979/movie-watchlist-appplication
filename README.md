## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB Atlas account for the database (replace `MONGO_URI` in `server/.env` with your MongoDB URI).
- Cloudinary account for media storage (replace `CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUD_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` in `server/.env` with your Cloudinary credentials).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com//Moviewatcher.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies
   ```sh
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the following:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://your_username:your_password@cluster0.your_host.mongodb.net/your_database?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   PORT=3001
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
   PASSWORD=your_email_password
   CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
   CLOUD_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
   ```
4. start the development server
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
5. Navigate to the frontend directory and create a `.env.local` file for client-side environment variables:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   REACT_APP_Backend_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ```
6. Install frontend dependencies and start the app
